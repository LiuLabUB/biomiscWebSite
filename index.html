  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>We are focusing on developing and applying computational
  approaches for studying transcriptional and epigenetics regulation
  in vairous models. We developed widely used open-source algorithms,
  including <a href="https://github.com/taoliu/MACS">MACS</a> (cited
  over 5,000 times according to Google Scholar) to analyze ChIP-seq
  data, and <a href="http://cistrome.org/ap">CistromeAP</a>, an
  integrative platform for comprehensive analyses on cis-regulatory
  elements, which has over 3,000 users. The PI, Tao Liu, was a member
  of the Data Analysis Center and Analysis Working Group of the ENCODE
  and modENCODE consortium and was involved in deciphering functional
  elements through analyzing high-throughput profiles of chromatin
  factors and in comparing chromatin features between fly, worm and
  human genome. We have actively participated in the development of
  ChIP-seq guidelines for the broad scientific communities. </p>
